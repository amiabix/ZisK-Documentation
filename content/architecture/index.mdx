# Architecture Overview

This section provides an in-depth look at the ZisK architecture and design decisions.

## System Architecture

ZisK is built with a modular, extensible architecture that prioritizes:

- **Performance** - Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Scalability** - Designed to grow with your needs
- **Maintainability** - Clean code and clear separation of concerns

## Core Components

- **Core Engine** - The main runtime and execution environment
- **Plugin System** - Extensible plugin architecture
- **Configuration Layer** - Flexible configuration management
- **API Layer** - RESTful API interface

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Each component is independent and reusable
2. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support throughout
3. **Developer Experience** - Intuitive APIs and clear error messages
4. **Performance First** - Optimized for production workloads
