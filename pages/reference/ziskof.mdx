# Ziskof

## Overview

Ziskof tests generate riscof test files, convert the corresponding `.elf` files into ZisK ROMs, and execute them providing the output in stdout for comparison against a reference RISCV implementation. This process is not trivial and has been semi-automatized.

## Running Ziskof Tests

### Step 1: Compile the ZisK Emulator

First, compile the ZisK Emulator:

```bash
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

### Step 2: Run Docker Tests

Download and run a Docker image from the riscof repository to generate and run the riscof tests:

```bash
docker run --rm -v ./target/release/ziskemu:/program -v ./riscof/:/workspace/output/ -ti hermeznetwork/ziskof:latest
```

The test can take a few minutes to complete. Any error would be displayed in red.
